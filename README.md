restack augments the experience of performing an interactive Git rebase to make
it more friendly to workflows that involve lots of interdependent branches. For
more background on why this exists and the workflow it facilitates, see
[Automatically Restacking Git Branches][1].

Installation
============

Binaries
--------

Pre-built ARM and 64-bit binaries are available for Linux and Mac at
<https://github.com/abhinav/restack/releases>. To install, simply unpack the
archive and put the binaries somewhere on your `$PATH`.

For example, if you have `$HOME/bin` on your `$PATH`,

    OS=$(go env GOOS)
    ARCH=$(go env GOARCH)
    VERSION=v0.3.0
    URL="https://github.com/abhinav/restack/releases/download/$VERSION/restack.$VERSION.$OS.$ARCH.tar.gz"
    curl -L "$URL" | tar xzv -C ~/bin

Build From Source
-----------------

If you have Go installed, you can install `restack` using the following
command.

    $ go get -u github.com/abhinav/restack/cmd/restack

Setup
=====

Automatic Setup
---------------

Run `restack setup` to configure `git` to use `restack`.

    $ restack setup

Manual Setup
------------

If you would rather not have `restack` change your `.gitconfig`, you can set
`restack` up manually.

Point your `sequence.editor` git configuration to the script generated by
`restack setup --print-edit-script`.

    $ restack setup --print-edit-script > bin/restack-edit.sh
    $ chmod +x bin/restack-edit.sh
    $ git config sequence.editor restack-edit.sh

The generated script will rely on the `restack edit` command if available,
falling back to your `GIT_EDITOR` if not.

You can also bypass the checks performed by the script and point
`sequence.editor` to the `restack edit` command directly.

    $ git config sequence.editor 'restack edit'

See `restack edit --help` for the different options accepted by `restack edit`.

Usage
=====

restack automatically recognizes branches being touched by the rebase and adds
rebase instructions which update these branches as their heads move.

The generated instruction list also includes an opt-in commented-out section
that will push these branches to the remote.

For example, given,

    o master
     \
      o A
      |
      o B (feature1)
       \
        o C
        |
        o D (feature2)
         \
          o E
          |
          o F
          |
          o G (feature3)
           \
            o H (feature4, HEAD)

Running `git rebase -i master` from branch `feature4` will give you the
following instruction list.

    pick A
    pick B
    exec git branch -f feature1

    pick C
    pick D
    exec git branch -f feature2

    pick E
    pick F
    pick G
    exec git branch -f feature3

    pick H

    # Uncomment this section to push the changes.
    # exec git push -f origin feature1
    # exec git push -f origin feature2
    # exec git push -f origin feature3

So any changes made before each `exec git branch -f` will become part of that
branch and all following changes will be made on top of that.
